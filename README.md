#checkList

I have created a simple checklist to keep necessary activities for senior citizens in check.

For the elderly to have a better lifestyle, some tasks must be essential, the objective of the project is to provide a checklist of essential tasks which are to be performed.
Once the user has finished the task, they can press the task button and to keep the daily activity in check, a reset button is added to repeat it daily.

I collected data from senior neighbors and asked them about their daily needs, then I selected the top four activities to create a check list, also included a helpline number 
in case of emergencies and a link to NHSC (National Helpline for Senior Citizens)

here are some screenshots:

Updates would be added such as a button to create new task.
